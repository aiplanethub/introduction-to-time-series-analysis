* In time series, we often observe similarities between past
and present values. That’s because we encounter
autocorrelation within such data. In other words, by
knowing the price of a product today, we can often make
a rough prediction about its valuation tomorrow. So, in
this tutorial, we will discuss a model that reflects
this correlation – the autoregressive model.
* Autoregressive Model is one of the most basic models
in time series analysis.

## What is Autoregressive Model (AR)?

A statistical model is autoregressive if it predicts future values based on past values. For example, an autoregressive model might seek to predict a stock's future prices based on its past performance.
