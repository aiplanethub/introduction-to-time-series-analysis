*  In time series, we sometimes observe similarities between past errors and present values. That’s because certain unpredictable events happen, and they need to be accounted for. In other words, by knowing how far off our estimation yesterday was as compared to the actual value, we can tweak our model so that it responds accordingly. So, in this tutorial, we will examine a model that considers past residuals - the Moving Average model.
* Moving averages are some of the core foundational concepts of time series analysis. This lesson will discuss moving averages and their various types: simple moving averages, weighted moving averages, exponential moving averages, and exponential smoothing moving averages.

## What are Moving Averages?

* Moving average forms the baseline model for time series analysis. 
* This is not only used in time series analysis but also used in typical machine learning models. For example, if you want to analyze your customer history to see what is the next best action, you can use the function of the moving average as a feature in your machine learning model.
* The video below will give you a better feel about Moving Averages. The instructor will explain moving average using a real-world example.
