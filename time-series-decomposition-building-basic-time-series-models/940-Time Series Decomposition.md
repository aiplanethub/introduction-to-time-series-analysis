## What is Time Series Decomposition?

* Time series decomposition involves considering a
series as a combination of trend, seasonality, and noise
components.
* Don’t worry about some of the terms that are not familiar to
you. You will get to know them as you progress through
the course.
* Decomposition provides a useful abstract model for thinking about time series generally and for better understanding problems during time series analysis and forecasting.

​
In the video below the instructor discusses about time series decomposition in detail and its implementation using a real world dataset.
