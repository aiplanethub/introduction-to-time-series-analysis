## Learning Objectives

* Why ARIMA Model?
* What is ARIMA Model?
* What is Auto-ARIMA Model?
* ARIMA Model - Implementation
* Notebook




## Why ARIMA Model?

* ARIMA Model is the reduced form equivalent of many
time series models.
* ARIMA is generally preferred when the data is stationary.



## What is ARIMA Model?

* The name ARIMA stands for Autoregressive Integrated
Moving Average.
* The tutor in the upcoming video explains the ARIMA model with
easy explanation and also points out why we are using the ARIMA
model in the given example and why not the ARMA model.
* Go through the video slowly and understand each part of
the video one by one.
